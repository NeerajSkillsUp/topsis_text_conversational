# 📊 Conversational AI Evaluation
An end-to-end framework for evaluating and ranking pre-trained conversational text models using the TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) algorithm.

This project provides a robust methodology to compare AI models (like GPT-2, DialoGPT, and OPT) based on a multi-criteria decision-making process. It balances linguistic quality against operational efficiency.

# 🛠 Methodology
The evaluation follows a structured multi-criteria decision analysis. Each model is graded on three distinct pillars: Accuracy (BLEU), Fluency (ROUGE), and Efficiency (Latency).

# 📈 Final Results
Below is the performance table generated by the framework:
